in C, function pointers point to code, not data
... a variable that contains the address of a function
        don't be trying pointer arithmetic on it

usually, a function pointer will store start of an executable
most of the time, you don't have to manage memory for function pointers

fp1  : basic function pointer
fp2  : array of function pointers
fp3  : pass function pointer as argument and return function pointer from function
fp4  : common application, qsort()     ...lots of good ones like this, bsearch, bubble, ect
fp5  : custom seach        only good for complex tasks, know when to use
fp6  : general function pointer use
