the python way to make a package is to put empty "__init__.py" in top level
then use relative path with dot notation
signals that a package exists...


the "f" string is better compression than .format() or oldschool if you are >3.6


imports set "__name__" to file name (no .py extension)
good practive to "main check" for stand-alone and packaged 

    if __name__ == '__main__' :
        # do something
__name__ == __main__ tells python to execute, not imports


witout ".py" extension, file will probably be a module (good for functions and classes)
from <mod_name> import <class/fun_name> <> <> ...







cool shit:
    repr()    return canonical string representation of an object
