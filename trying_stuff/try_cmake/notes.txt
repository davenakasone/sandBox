cmake is a little better than make and common enough so everyone will probably know it
it does makes you look less incompetent than you would if a Makefile was used

notes:
use "out-of-source" builds (don't mix compilied binaries with source code)
CMakeLists.txt is a text file that contains cmake's language "cmake-language"
cmake, ccmake, and cmake-gui are all options for building

Any build configuration, by default:
Debug- has the basic debug flags turned on. 
Release- has the basic optimizations turned on. 
MinSizeRel- has flags that produce the smallest object code, but not necessarily the fastest code. 
RelWithDebInfo- builds an optimized build with debug information as well.

cmake variables being with CMAKE_
When you set a variable, it is visible to:
- current CMakeLists file or function
- any subdirectoryâ€™s CMakeLists files
- any functions or macros that are invoked
- any files that are included using the include command
