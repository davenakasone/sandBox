decorators allow behavior changes of a function without modifying the function
- add debug/logging
- validate funtion inputs + outputs
- testing/verification
- check permissions
see PEP318

python has a lot of implementaions, just pick one (or make one) for your use case
cpython is the most common
in every implementation, everything is an object, even the basic datatypes
"str" is not really a null terminated c-string, but an object with some attributes + methods that is named "str"
same for int, float, ...,and even the function
