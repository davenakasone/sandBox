To calculate a bond with coupon payments, you would need to use the following formula:

PV = C / r * (1 - 1 / (1 + r)^n) + F / (1 + r)^n

Where:
PV = Present value of the bond
C = Coupon payment
r = Discount rate (also known as the yield to maturity)
n = Number of periods until maturity
F = Face value of the bond

Here are the steps to calculate a bond with coupon payments:

1) Determine the coupon payment: 
    This is the annual interest payment on the bond, 
    expressed as a percentage of the face value. 
    For example, if a bond has a face value of $1,000 and a coupon rate of 5%, 
    the coupon payment would be $50 per year.

2) Determine the yield to maturity: 
    This is the rate of return required by investors to buy the bond. 
    It takes into account the current market price of the bond, its face value, and the coupon payments. 
    You can use a financial calculator or a spreadsheet program to calculate the yield to maturity.

Determine the number of periods until maturity: This is the number of years until the bond reaches its maturity date. For example, if a bond has a maturity date of 10 years from now, the number of periods until maturity would be 10.

Determine the face value of the bond: This is the amount that the bond will be worth at maturity. For example, if a bond has a face value of $1,000, the face value would be $1,000.

Plug in the values into the formula: Use the formula above to calculate the present value of the bond. The result will be the price that investors would be willing to pay for the bond.

It's important to note that this formula assumes that the bond pays coupons annually. If the bond pays coupons semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly, you would need to adjust the formula accordingly.
