""" 
    The present value of an annuity is the current value 
    of a series of equal periodic payments, discounted to their present value. 
    It represents the amount of money that would need to be invested now 
    to generate a stream of future cash flows.

    To calculate the present value of an annuity, you need to know the following variables:

        - The periodic payment amount
        - The number of payments
        - The discount rate or the rate of return required on the investment.

    the formula to calculate the present value of an annuity is:

        PV = C * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]

    PV = Present Value of the annuity
    C = Payment amount
    r = Discount rate or rate of return
    n = Number of payments
