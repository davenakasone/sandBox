// 28, 

make your "modules"

make a test bench (pay attention to the house-keeping procedures)
    note that modelsim, icarus, and others may be different

when all the code is good, "compile" the TB
    be in the same directory as the files

        $ iverilog -Wall -o <your_TB>.vvp <your_TB>.v

if there are no errors, run the object file:

        $ vvp <your_TB>.vvp

double click the *.vcd file to view the wave

makes sure the TB has:

    $dumpvars(0, <tb_name>);
    $dumpfile("wave.vcd");
    ...
    $finish;
