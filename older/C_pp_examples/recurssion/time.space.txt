1 unit of time.... don't get into seconds, nano, ect
time and space is one of the most important things you need to measure

time is independent of the hardware, you have to look at basic repetitions. 
it is all about the algoritm / procedure
find the variable that time depends on   usually it is the list size
degree / order     also O, Omget, Theta   asymptotic notations   
you can meausre time complexiy from code or diagram   both should match

no need to get into assembly operations...just count all as 1

space is off of the variables, amounts, ect   don't get concerned with bytes

make your theoretical time and space functions match actual performance
