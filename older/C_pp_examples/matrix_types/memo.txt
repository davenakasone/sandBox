lots of important types, these are just a few:

Diagonal
lower-triangular
upper-triangular
symmetric
tridiagonal
band
toeplit
sparse

n x n is sqaure, and useful
if there are a lot of null cells, you can store them efficiently

square band matrix is like tri-diagonal....you have a lot of empty,
still take advantage of diagonals...just a different calculation

recursion is an option if it won't exceed your call stack ( < 10k in most cases)
just make your tree and adjust to accomplish the task
or just use std::stack to help iterate what you want to do recursivley
