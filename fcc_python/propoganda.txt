never put the same data in different entries (make everything else in the database copy it)
that way, there is only one point of failure, one place copies come from, etc

organizing data is important, use a database when possible (they are well proven)
you should be able to plan everything on paper before writting any code
relationships should be used to eliminate verital repitition
use a key to point, instead of making a lot of copies (primary, logic, foreign)
work from leaves up for a database

the relationship is important
1:many
many:many  // junction table
many:1
...
if you want any type of scale, you need a database, it can't be ignored
be sure to look at your data (visualize)

it is nice to have a raw data base and a clean/processed data base
use the raw database to pull data
use the clean data base for program use

robots.txt
usually at root of website, says what crawlers can and can't do
database should be the presistent list (won't go away when program stops)

programming should power your data analysis
acquire data, clean data, transform data, analyze data, do something with results
