1. Simulate the circuit for the summation algorithm on GDP.  
Take the screenshots of the simulation report. 
You can use EDAPlayground or ModelSim.

The testbench and the design files are copied into a single file  
    Download single filehere.

2. Determine the proper clock for the circuit using TimeQuest analysis. 
Show the screenshots of the clock report (clock to clock)  
before and after setting the correct value of the clock.
