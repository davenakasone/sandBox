Get the multiplicand from the command-line arguments.
Get the multiplier from the command-line arguments.
Set an accumulator: answer = 0;
Loop "multiplier" times:
    answer = answer + multiplicand
Output the answer.

Multiplicand    Multiplier
           9            13

The left column is progressively halved and the integer floor is kept. 
This progression continues all the way down to 1. 
The right column is doubled as many times as there are digits in the left column.

Multiplicand    Multiplier
           9            13
           4            26
           2            52
           1           104

Now remove any rows that have even numbers in the multiplicand column:
Multiplicand    Multiplier
           9            13
           1           104

The answer is found by adding all the numbers remaining in the Multiplier column.
Multiplicand    Multiplier
   13
+ 104
-----
  117
