data is integral part of program
program is instructions to perform operations on data
without data...there isn't much

1) Data structure    arrangement of data so it can be used efficiently (inside memory during operation of program)
        how program is going to manage data so it can perform operations
        CPU executes instructions, RAM is temporary/primary, HD is permenant storage
        program file gets installed to storage    so does data     both also come into main memory when called
        CPU starts to execute program file, if program needs data file, it must come into main memory
        program can't directly process data if it stays on storage
        every program needs to deal with data....how you organize data (structure it) inside main memory is very important
        that is why data structures are formed in main memory, part of a running program ...make it efficient
        you can get speed and save memory if you use the right data structure

2) Data base    when data is larger in size, you can't keep it all in main memory
        this relational data stays on a disc   maybe a database table   all have a relationship between them
        again you need a data structure so it can be accessed by programs easily
3) Data warehouse     old/legacy data not needed in daily function, but may be used to make decision... have to mine

4) Big data     internet making fuck loads of data     a lot more complex to analyze, but all still use data structures
            mostly only can live online
